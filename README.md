# Tobey's BepInEx Pack for Megastore Simulator

This is a [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) pack for Megastore Simulator, preconfigured and ready to use on Windows and Linux, including SteamOS and Steam Deck handhelds!

In particular, this pack comes with:

-   [Tobey's Game Info Logger for BepInEx](https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.BepInEx.GameInfo), a simple BepInEx plugin to log information about the currently loaded Unity game,
-   [Tobey's File Tree Logger for BepInEx](https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.FileTree), a configurable BepInEx plugin which logs the game's file tree to aid in troubleshooting issues, and
-   [Tobey's Timestamp Logger for BepInEx](https://github.com/toebeann/Tobey.BepInEx.Timestamp), a configurable BepInEx patcher which logs the current timestamp.

## Installation

> [!TIP]
>
> **Make sure to check out the [Installing mods](#installing-mods) section once you have finished installing this pack!**

> [!TIP]
>
> **The game folder is the folder containing the game's executable (e.g. `Megastore Simulator.exe`).**
>
> Steam users can find the game folder by right-clicking the game in their Steam library and selecting `Manage` > `Browse local files`.

### Quick start

#### Windows

Extract the .zip into the game folder replacing any files if prompted, run the game once to generate all needed files and folders, then quit the game at the main menu and you're good to go. Remember to check the [Installing mods](#installing-mods) section for info on how to install mods!

If something doesn't go according to plan or you need further guidance, please refer to the [full instructions](#full-instructions-for-windows-linux-and-steam-deck-handhelds). Don't worry, it looks harder than it is. **Please don't skimread!**

#### Linux and Steam Deck handhelds

Same as for Windows but additionally follow step 4 from the [full instructions](#full-instructions-for-windows-linux-and-steam-deck-handhelds).

For Steam Deck handhelds, switch to Desktop mode to follow the instructions. Once you've got it all working, you'll be able to play with mods in either Desktop or Gaming mode as preferred.

1. [Download Tobey's BepInEx Pack for Megastore Simulator](https://github.com/toebeann/BepInEx.MegastoreSimulator/releases/latest/download/Tobey.s.BepInEx.Pack.for.Megastore.Simulator.zip).
2. Make sure the game is not running.
3. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive into the game folder. Replace any files if prompted.

    **ℹ️** _That just means open the .zip file and drag the files and folders out into the game folder!_

    If done correctly, inside your game folder it should look something like this (the entries in bold being from the pack):

    **⚠️ _This list is used as a reference and is non-exhaustive, there will be other stuff, please don't delete anything!_**

    - _**`BepInEx`**_
    - `Megastore Simulator_Data`
    - _**`doorstop_config.ini`**_
    - `Megastore Simulator.exe`
    - _**`winhttp.dll`**_

        **⚠️ _If you are missing any of these files or folders, you are probably installing to the wrong place, and this pack will not work._**

4. **Skip this step if you play on Windows!**

    Linux and Steam Deck handheld users: go to your Steam library, right-click the game, select `Properties...` and set the launch options:

    ```sh
    WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%
    ```

    **⚠️ _Do not set the launch options if you play the game on Windows, or the game won't run!_**

    **ℹ️** _If preferred, Linux users can instead set the Wine configuration (`winecfg`) for the game to add `winhttp` as a DLL override via the `Libraries` tab. Remove the launch options if applicable. [Full instructions here](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html)._

5. Run the game as normal.

    Note that you should _always_ launch the game with Steam - do not run the .exe file directly (nor via a shortcut to the .exe), as launching the .exe directly causes issues for BepInEx. You can set up a BepInEx-compatible shortcut on your desktop by right-clicking the game in Steam and selecting `Manage` > `Add desktop shortcut`.

6. Exit the game at the main menu.

Assuming you have followed these instructions correctly, inside the `BepInEx` folder there will now be a file `LogOutput.log` (or simply `LogOutput` - it's the same thing). This is your log file, and it will be egenerated every time the game runs with technical and diagnostic information about your installed mods, and any errors that might happen while playing. It's very useful for troubleshooting, and it is recommended to share it whenever asking for help with your mods. It is equivalent to the BepInEx console window you might be familiar with, containing all of the same information.

If this file is missing, it usually means that you have not installed the pack correctly and you should probably try again from scratch. Make sure to pay careful attention to the instructions and don't skimread any of the steps.

Otherwise, you can now install mods according to the [Installing mods](#installing-mods) section below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **With just this pack installed, you will not see any changes in-game!**
>
> Check the file `BepInEx` > `LogOutput.log` to determine whether BepInEx has loaded.

## Installing mods

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Always make sure the game is not running when installing, removing or otherwise changing mod files!**

Installing BepInEx mods is generally as simple as opening up their .zip and dragging the contents into the right folder.

Typically, that folder is `BepInEx` > `plugins` unless the mod's instructions say otherwise. Sometimes they will want you to drag their contents directly into the game folder, or directly into the `BepInEx` folder. You should use some common sense and check the mod's instructions if you're not sure.

If you can't figure out how to install a specific mod, make sure to double check the instructions on the mod page. If there aren't any instructions on the mod page or you simply don't understand them, you'll have to get in touch with the author of the mod somehow. Your best bet is usually going to be the Nexus Mods posts tab of that mod. Make sure to check the question hasn't already been asked and answered!
